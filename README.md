# Chat

Just a little chat app where you can chat about various topics (chosen by me). No login required.

This app is built on the following stack: React, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, yarn, Bootstrap and SCSS. Also various js libraries are used (such as RxJS, react-bootstrap, moment, lodash and React mini router).
